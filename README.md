3. Write a small story (one paragraph or so) that details a user's experience of discovering your domain, visiting it within a particular context (like mobile, desktop, while hungry, at a funeral, etc.), experiencing what it has to offer, and subsequently leaving.

  Weather:
  The user is searching either the web or giphy's API for a fun interesting way to wake up to viewing the weather in the morning. The user could be doing this from their mobile phone in the morning or at the office during the day.

  API:
  littleBits is a electronics company who's mission is to put the power of electronics in the hands of everyone. This site will be targeted towards the power users who understand eletronic and has experience using api's. They would find this page after using the "cloudBit module" which connects littleBits electronics to the internet.



4. Would somebody return to your domain after visiting it for the first time - in how long do you think - and why?

  Both domains are intended for users to continuously use. The weather site they would continue to use it until they get tired of waking up or in other words their dead.
